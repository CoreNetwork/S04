    Adminium, or Bedrock as it is more commonly reffered to, is a useful block in flatcore. Located just three blocks under the surface of the overworld, it is easily one of the most valuable features. Mobs cannot spawn on Bedrock. This includes
- 'both passive and hostile. This opens up many options for exploitation. If you find
  yourself alone and unarmed in a dangerous situation, contrary to rule number two
  in minecraft, simply dig straight down. Replace the block of grass above your head
  and '
- 'freely tunnel thousand of blocks in the dark without fear of a creeper. Tunnels
  can also be used to transport villagers safely. Need soulsand, clay or quartz? Make
  your way carefully down to Bedrock in the nether and strip mine to your hearts content. '
- Bedrock is also used as a barrier, both as walls in the nether as well as a ceiling. Attempting to circumvent it will inevitebaly lead to death.
