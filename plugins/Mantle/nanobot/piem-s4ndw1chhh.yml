- '"Can I make a treat amazingly charming, great for lunch, heavenly, delicious, amusing,
  marvelous, and super? Honestly? Your answer is \"cookie\"? Damn. You are mistaken,
  man. Obviously. \"Hamburger\" might imaginably correspond suitably. "'
- '"Well, I correctly predict a result: \"Submarine.\" Huh? Bizarrely illogical! Yes,
  however, think laboriously. Truly, \"Sandwich\" is ordinarily befitting, however.
  Okay, brilliant! Have some! Taste! Scrumptious, huh? Astounding! "'
- '"Another? Certainly. ...enough. Can\u0027t counteract flavor so powerful, really.
  So entrancing. Enticing. Wonderful. Fantastic. Tempting. Anyway, sandwiches definitely
  are good. Desserts? So hyped. You want more sugared, disgusting grease? "'
- '"Grossly fattening \"delights\"? So I hear. Wondrous, incredibly wondrous, though
  maybe more sandwiches could discourage sweets. Sweets won\u0027t satisfy particular
  tastebuds. You identify with them? Choose faithfully. "'
- '"...Wonderful! Sorry. Scary atmosphere, right? Reassure it to you, I proudly do.
  Truly, our house carefully begs compassion, although I do execrate food, \"sandwich\"
  a different case. Tacos? Definitely ok. Actually, other exceptions withstand."'
- '"Hamburgers, I postulate, are sandwich items. Do we understand? Quick, small snack.
  Submarine season this year really is interesting. Fine sandwich, genuinely tasty.
  Let\u0027s stimulate our miraculous and exclusive tastebuds.\n"'
