         Arachnids

           &7vol. II

   &8Spiders are large arachnids with a terri- fying condition: during night, or in darkness, they become hostile and will stop at nothing to satisfy their
- |-
  &8hunger. The cure for this state is to sur-
  round them with bright lights, which will turn them seemingly passive in most instances.

   Athletic and strong, Spiders will pounce on any prey they can, and even have the ability to scale walls. Some Spiders are
- '&8exposed to potion eff- ects for periods of time, making them even more resistant and deadlier than before. Therefore, a Flatcor- ian should watch out for any Spider giving off peculiar glow, they could be bestowed with super strength, speed or worse.'
- ' &8Rarely, an invisible Spider has been sighted. Beware these foul abominations and
  look out for their glo- wing eyes which give away their position.'
