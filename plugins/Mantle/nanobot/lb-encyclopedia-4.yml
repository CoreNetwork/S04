- '"Arachnids similar to those from home, only much larger. Capable of climbing walls
  quickly and jumping great distances.\n\nSome spiders appear to be almost transparent,
  with our expedition guards being only capable of tracking them using their red eyes."'
- '"Some spiders appear to be experimented on (see §lSECTION 72§r), some have enhanced
  speed or regeneration. \nCan often distinguish these effects by a characteristic
  glow. They also respond to other spiders in danger."'
- '"These spiders only remain hostile during the dark, and appear to be passive after
  dawn. This is likely due to poor iris adjustment to the daylight, making them almost
  blind from overexposure."'
