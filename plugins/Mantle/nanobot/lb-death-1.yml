      &2A Brief History
          of Death

            &7vol. I

   &8I have committed my life to exploring ruins and investigating tales of times long past. Throughout my studies I have encoutered one constant; one race of
- '&8guardians, if you will, in every culture that existed in our flat plains. They
  seem to be reverred quite highly in most socie- ties. 
  
  
  Each version of the legend
  is different but the oldest revision I can find seems to go roughly like this:'
- " &8A long time ago, death was permanent. When you died, you would lose your corporeal\

  &8this depressing state of reality. They were called

  \ to another plane of exi- stence, but legends say they can take corporeal form\
  \ and walk among us. Many cultures consider them guardians of the "

  &8great plains.

   I am skeptical about their existence, as a society as powerful as the Minads would leave some kind of trace... but in my travels I have come across a coded log. What I could decipher of it seemed to talk about... travel through time.

  &8If they were indeed to posess this techno- logy, erasing their own existence would be trivial.

   Many academics, myself included, worry about what this means to our society.
