- Scholars tell of ages past where a man could walk to the end of the world and find a giant wall seperating them from the land beyond. Some Flatcorians were foudn living side by side in harmony with the wall, caring and maintaining it as it protected them.
- "Other bolder Flatcorians attempted to tame the wall, interested in the world beyond\
  \ they mounted the wall and vanished, their futures unknown.\n\nOne scholar would\
  \ spend his time in the centre of the world, preaching to Flatcorians as they "
- 'visited the Commerce Centre, warning against these adventures beyond the wall.
  He claimed that the land beyond the wall was sacred and if those Flatcorians continued
  to desecrate the land, the darkness would come and all would be lost. Many called
  the '
- "scholar crazy and said he should be locked up, many tried to remove him from town.\
  \ One day they got their wish as he vanished, no sign or trace of where he went.\n\
  \nMany forgot the scholar and his words as the days "
- 'progressed, trade flourished in the world, many new buildings were created, life
  was simple and comfortable. Then one day the sky went dark, the moon and stars didn''t
  rise, the world was black and life stopped. Many months passed in the darkness, '
- "Flatcorians waited for the sun to shine, hoping to live again. \n\nThen one day\
  \ the sun came back and Flatcorians with it, but the world as they knew it was no\
  \ more. Buildings were gone, everything worked on vanished. New animals could be\
  \ found in the "
- 'world which many tried to ride and use for carrying their goods. Time progressed
  until one day when a Flatcorian remembered the crazy old scholar and his words about
  the darkness. In order to see if the words were true, the Flatcorian set out to
  find the '
- "world and to see what was beyond.\n\nHe travelled and travelled until realising\
  \ that he was past the point where the wall should have been, the wall was gone,\
  \ the beyond could come and get them. The Flatcorian mustered the courage to keep "
- 'going, pushing himself as far as possible and almost took the one final step before
  realising there was nothing below him, the world really did end. Looking of he edge
  he could see nothing, he shot an arrow and waited for a noise but heard nothing
  still, '
- 'he knew there wasn''t. Stepping back he realised he needed to see how far this
  world end stretched for, maybe there was somewhere he could break through. Alas,
  travelling revealed nothing but emptiness. The scholar was right, the darkness had
  claimed it '
- "all. \n\nA final chilling thought as he asked himself, what was the wall protecting\
  \ us from and what is yet to come? He hurried back to town to warn everyone, beware\
  \ of The Void."
