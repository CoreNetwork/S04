- "Today my Father, my little brother and I were helping to rebuild the barn, the\
  \ last one burnt down, maybe building it out of wood and hay isn't the best idea.\n\
  \nThis time around we are trying this strange new material Dad said he found out\
  \ on one "
- 'of his trips to find found supplies at the strange buildings dotting the landscape
  around the vast field we live in, Dad doesn''t like to talk about why they are there
  and where the people have gone, the people like us who can talk, talking about that '

  seems to upset him so we don't ask much.

  This new materials is extremely dark with hints of purple, it looks very strong, Dad says he thinks it might be fire proof, I hope so.

  We build the entire frame out of this dark
- |
  material, we will build the everything else with Stone this time, stone doesn't burn but it very heavy so the supports are only 2 meters apart this time.

  Before Dad wants to start working on the stone he wants to fire test the frame.
- |-
  He pulls out a flint and steel and tells us to watch from the house in case something goes wrong.

  He lights a base support and for a few moments the flame burns strong and then the flame goes out and in it's place the entire wall section erupts
- |-
  into what looks like purple smoke circling around inside it.

  Dad looks intrigued, we are horrified, he yells to us to stay inside.

  He reaches forward and touches the purple smoke, it doesn't seem to harm him, he holds his hand
- |-
  inside it for a moment and then he dissappeared.

  I can't believe it, Dad is gone, what are we going to do. My Brother has started to cry, I'm not too far behind.

  And then he comes back, appears just like he dissappeared
- ", he runs to the house and yells to lock the door behind him when he comes through\
  \ the door so we do.\n\nHe is panting hard, he tells us a long story about how there\
  \ are black skeletons that wonder a great red plain, these skeletons don't carry\
  \ bows "
- |
  but they are aggressive just the same, he tells us that there are Pigs that walk like men and look like they are rotting from the inside out, they are also aggresive, he says that it's hot there, like someone left the fire going all night long.
- "He doesn't seem to want to talk about it after a while, I think he's afraid the\
  \ creatures will follow him back here, to us.\n\nWe don't sleep soundly that night.\n\
  \nIn the morning we thoroughly inspect the yard before leaving "
- "the house before even unlocking the door, Dad is going back in, he says he saw\
  \ a structure, just the ones he tells us about sometimes.\n\nHe dons his Leather\
  \ Armour and his brand new Sword made from the last of our Iron and heads back into "
- |-
  the Red Land.

  He comes back 2 days later telling tales of strange beasts that sound like pigs and walk like men, highly aggressive but easy to outrun.
  He tells about a set of towers where he found some Gold, he wants us to come with him.
- |-
  It takes a while to convince us but we follow, with Leather armour and stone swords we go through the door with Dad.

  It is hot, and dark, a strange place, it's perfectly flat, just like home, familiar but scary, the ground is made or some red
- |-
  hot gravel.

  We follow Dad as he leads us around packs of the creatures he mentioned for a long time until we spot the towers in the distance, great obelisks or strucutre reaching higher than one can see.
  He warns that he
- |-
  heard strange noises from a beast he'd never heard before inside the tower but with 3 of us we can carry more Gold home.

  We enter the tower and quickly follow Dad up a stair case to a chest where we find the Gold. We all grab as much as we can
- 'and before we leave Dad says he just wants to check what is on the next floor so
  he runs up the next stair case and says it''s safe and to come up, he sees another
  stair case to another level and asks us if we''re ok if he takes it to check, we
  are and he '
- |-
  does.

  From the floor above he calls us to come see, another much larger stair case reaches up into the sky but at the base of the stairs is another chest, we open it and find Gold Armour!

  Dad is excited, we
- 'grab the armour and turn to leave when a strange burning noise appears behind us,
  it''s some elemental beast we''d only heard about in old tales. Dad is startled
  and jumps in front of us to swing at the creature, his sword lands and he hurt it
  but not '
- |-
  enough, it shoots fire at Dad and hit's hirm hard, with his next strike he kills the beast as he yells for us to run home. I send my brother down the stairs as quickly as he can run.
  He can't see this.

  I watch as Dad dies in front of me.
- |-
  Horrified I run down the stairs looking for my Brother with tears running down my face.

  I find him standing out the front of the tower in the field between them, staring at something in the sky, as i approach I yell to him to get back home with me right
- "now.\nHe isn't listening.\nI see what has his attention, the Sky Beast.\nThe enormous\
  \ white beast floats in the air in front oh my Brother peacefully singing a song\
  \ to itself. My Brother breaks his gaze to turn to face me. As he sees the "
- "tears in my eyes, as he asks where Dad is, the beast spits some massive ball out\
  \ of it's mouth, I scream as it hits my Brother in the back. He dies instantly.\n\
  \ \nI ran back to the portal distraught.\nWhen I get home and make it through the\
  \ door again I run "
- |-
  to grab Dad's special pickaxe and tear down the black material as quickly as I can.

  I'm never going back and my family is never coming back.
