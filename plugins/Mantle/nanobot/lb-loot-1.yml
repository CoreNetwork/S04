  &8The Better Blacksmith Bureo (BBB) has in- structed all smiths of
- '&8Flatcore to remove the storage chests from the back of their shops saying, "Too long have Flatcorians looted our stores instead of conducting fair trade!" This news came as a shock to Flatcorians every- where as these chests often contained vital goods'
- '&8not available during barter from any adult villager. The BBB has formally denied the existance of those non-tradable goods despite ample proof. We interviewed some local blacksmiths to get their opinion, but they were unable to say more than "Umm..." or'
- '&8"Hmm..." on the matter.

  Rumors have emerged in the Flatcore comm- unity that
  mysterious structures have appeared throughout the world containing many of the
  irreplace- able items previously found in blacksmiths. Some Flatcorians pro- claimed
  that these'
- '&8are the work of the mythical Minads but experts are waiting for a chance to exa- mine the structures themselves before coming to any conclu- sions.'
