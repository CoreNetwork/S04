- "      Enderfuckers\n\nPhillip Redfield\nJune 3rd\nDiary entry\n\nI've lived in\
  \ the Flatlands my entire life, my parents migrated here from a far off land before\
  \ I was born.\nI like the Flatlands "
- "you can see as far as your eyes will let you and it never rains here, I've been\
  \ told the rain is an awful curse.\nI till my fields every year and make a good\
  \ harvest, my Donkey Geoffrey and I earn our keep.\nSince my Parents \ndissappeared\
  \ one "
- "night from their bedroom locked from the inside I've taken over the farm, maybe\
  \ they went out the window, maybe I imagined the lock, maybe they're coming back\
  \ soon, life goes on strong, Geoffrey and I will spend our lives here at the \n\
  farm. We'll be fine"

  I keep telling myself.

  Until now, until that thing appeared, I've been dealing with Zombies and Skeletal Archers and strange beasts that explode, but this thing, this gangly black beast that lurks outside my gate this night, I have never seen before.
- "it sings a soft mumble as it ambles around my fence, I wonder what it's looking\
  \ for, where it came from, what it wants.\nI creep outside to see whether it notices\
  \ my presences or even wants to harm me, I carry my sword and my hardened leather\
  \ chestplate. "

  Just in case.

  For the first time I look directly at it's face, I can see that it has deep purple eyes as it turns to face me, they almost look gentle.

  Boy was I wrong.

- |-
  With a strangely stiff motion it turns its whole body to face me and opens it's mouth, what a ghastly beast, you can see straight through the back of it's throat into the cold night.
  It begins to shake and lets out a horse moan and then it happens.
- |-
  I'm no longer inside my yard with one hand on my loyal Donkey, I'm standing outside my fence and this beast is in between my house and I and advancing quickly, it looks mad, I have no idea how I got out here, it's almost like I was teleported.

  I scramble
- "for a good foothold as the thing advances, I know it means me harm now.\n\nAs it\
  \ comes within slashing range I take my first strike and so does it, it sends me\
  \ flying, before I hit the ground I land my second strike on the beast, it does\
  \ not "
- |-
  seem too bothered by my sword.

  It disappears, gone, I hear the strange noise from behind me.

  I turn to see the beast advancing from behind me now, what is going on.
  I stand my ground and attack again.
- |-
  The beast seems wounded, as am I.

  The sun is rising.

  It disappears again, I know what to expect this time, I turn on my heels and lay a blow that downs the beast, as it hits the ground it lets out a horrible cry that haunts me.
- |-
  In the beautiful orange glow of the rising sun I noticed a glint, something is shining in the grass from where the beast fell.

  An orb, a beatiful deep green orb.
  I take it and myself inside the house and clean my wounds before examining this
- |-
  strange artifact the beast was carrying.
  I stare at it for what feels like 30 seconds before I realise it's midday, I've got work to, can't dwell on the happenings of the night.
  Frustrated with my time wasting I throw the orb out the window, I won't be
- |-
  needing it anymore.

  Again, woosh, I'm not in my house, I'm in the field where the orb would've landed, teleported.

  Is this what the beast uses to get behind me?
  Is this what it used to summon me?
- |
  Is this how it killed my parents inside a locked room?
  I will go out again tonight, I will find the beast again and I will slay it once more and further examine this strange pearl like thing.
  I will update this entry when I arrive home.
- |-
  If I never come home, keep Geoffrey Safe.

  Phillip Redfield.
