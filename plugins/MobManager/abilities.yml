# Here you define your ability sets for each mob type, giving them names
#     which are used in MobAbilities.
# Names must be totally unique (Different case does not count)
# Names must not contain spaces

#   MiscExampleSet:
#     MobType: ZOMBIE
#     ProtectFromDespawner: true
#     ApplyNormalAbilities: true
#     Abilities: {}
# 
# Nodes:
# - MobType: Defines the default type of this Ability Set
# - ProtectFromDespawner: If true, mobs with this Ability Set
#     will be protected from MobManagers despawner
# - ApplyNormalAbilities: If true, normal abilities will be applied
#     on top of the Ability Sets abilities.
#     (Ability Set abilities will override normal ones if they exist)
# - Abilities: Defines the abilities which will be applied
#     to the set
#     
# NOTE: Since v2.5 Abilities for AbilitySets are created in almost
#     the exact same way as normal abilities. Refer to them for
#     information on their use. 
#     
# NOTE: The MobType Node is only used in /mm spawnset to determine
#     which mob should be spawned along with a given AbilitySet
#     (If a MobType is not provided)
#     
# NOTE: A default AbilitySet exists with no abilities. To use this call
#     The AbilitySet 'NONE' under 'ApplySets' for your mob
# 
# #######################################################################
# LimitBonusSpawns
# #######################################################################
# If this is true Bonus spawns (From Birth/Death Spawns) will be
#     restricted by the Limiter component of MobManager.
#     (So you do not go over your mob limits)
# 
# If this is false Bonus spawns (From Birth/Death Spawns) will always
#     spawn every mob
# 
# #######################################################################
# BonusSpawnRange
# #######################################################################
# This is the default range used as the maximum range a mob can spawn
#     away from....
#     - A player when using /mm pspawn
#     - A parent mob when a Birth/Death spawns occurs
#     
# #######################################################################
# BonusSpawnHeightRange
# #######################################################################
# This is the default height range used as the maximum height a mob
#     can spawn away from....
#     - A player when using /mm pspawn
#     - A parent mob when a Birth/Death spawn occurs
# 
# #######################################################################   
# UseCircleLocationGeneration
# #######################################################################
# If this is true MobManager uses an algorithm which generates random
#     locations in a circle around a center location when spawning
#     mobs.
#     
# If this is false a (About 3.6 times faster) algorithm is used instead which
#     generates random locations in a square around the center location
#     
# It is recommended that this is left as false
# 
# #######################################################################
# BonusSpawnUseRadius
# #######################################################################
# This value determines if Birth/Death spawns uses random locations
#     around the parent mob to spawn child mobs
# true = use random locations
# false = don't use random locations
# 
# #######################################################################
# CommandSpawnUseRadius
# #######################################################################
# This value determines if the command /mm spawn uses random locations
#     around the center location to spawn mobs
# true = use random locations
# false = don't use random locations
# 
# #######################################################################
# CommandPSpawnUseRadius
# #######################################################################
# This value determines if the command /mm pspawn uses random locations
#     around the players location to spawn mobs
# true = use random locations
# false = don't use random locations
# 
# #######################################################################
# CommandPSpawnRadiusAllowCenter
# #######################################################################
# If this is true then /mm pspawn and /mm pspawnset will not allow
#     mobs to spawn on top of a player.
#     This can sometimes happen when the player is in an enclosed space
# 
# #######################################################################
# UseWorldSettings
# #######################################################################
# If this is false then settings 'EnabledSpawnReasons' and 'MobAbilities'
# will have no effect, and the global configuration for mobs will be used
# 
# NOTE: This setting does nothing in the global config
# 
# #######################################################################
# EnabledSpawnReasons
# #######################################################################
# When a Mob spawns, it is spawned with a given 'SpawnReason'
#     This list defines which of those 'SpawnReasons' that MobManager
# 	will check for.
# If a mob spawns with a listed 'SpawnReason' MobManager will apply
#     abilities to the mob
# 	
# Hint: If you have other plugins which spawn mobs with special gear
#     you can remove CUSTOM from the list of enabled spawn reasons
# 	so MobManager does not interfere with this
# 
# Note: By default all spawn reasons are checked
# 
# Valid spawn reasons can be found here:
#     http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/event/entity/CreatureSpawnEvent.SpawnReason.html
# 
# #######################################################################
# MobAbilities
# #######################################################################
# Contains settings you can use to edit mob attributes.
# 
# Mob settings in world files will override global settings
# 
# Mob names must be acquired from here:
#     http://jd.bukkit.org/apidocs/org/bukkit/entity/EntityType.html
#     And should be in all upper-case
# 
# There are currently two types of mob Attributes/Abilities:
# 1) Rate: These have a single fixed chance of doing something
# 
#     rates are written as a simple number between 1.0 and 0.0
# 
# 2) ChanceList: These are a list of chances with values associated
#     with each chance. The chance of a given value being selected is
#     (chance) / (Sum of all chances)
#     
#     Each ChanceList has keys which can be used to customize the abilities
#     These keys can have numbers, strings or lists as their values.
#     
#     NOTE: Every Ability requires the key 'Chance'
#     
#     ChanceLists are written as below
#     <OPTION>:
#     - CHANCE: <Chance>
#       <KEY>: <Options>
