  - '&7Mob spawning is somewhat adjusted to not lag the server. Animals spawn in a slow continuous loop around the map to make sure new players can find and claim them. Yes, horses too no more than 1 per "pack" making them rare). Villagers, Golems and Squid spawn completely normally. All mobs must obey &f/limits&7.'

  - '&7Monster spawning &7mechanics are completely changed.'
  - '&f1. &fHorizontally&7, monsters spawn between 25 and 72 blocks away from you. Monsters further than that will despawn really quickly. If you are moving, mobs behind you will despawn quicker than those you are currently facing.'
  - '&f2. &fVertically&7, monsters spawn in a designated range, of which you are the center. In overworld it''s &f32 &7blocks up and 32 down from you, in Nether only &f16&7. Think of it like a layer cake. If you want to maximize your grinder''s output, make sure it can fit inside that layer. Remember, you are the vertical center of the spawn layer.'
  - '&f3. &7Flying mobs (Ghasts) have additional 32 blocks when it comes to vertical range (16 + 32 = &f48&7).'
  - '&f4. &7There is a &fmaximum cap for monsters &7in each world, based on number of loaded chunks in that world (somewhat related to number of players online with exception of community towns). If that cap is reached, monsters won''t spawn unless someone frees up some slots (killing, waiting for them to burn, etc).'
