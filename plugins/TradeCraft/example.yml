# Currency item ID is a faster way to define prices in the tree below
# Instead of defining the emerald ID and amount, you can just do currency: 5 
# for 5 emeralds
Currency: 388

# A trade completed for the first time has 100% chance to restock all trades
# Subsequent trading has only 20% chance to restock all trades.
# Please notice that because you can complete a single trade 3-13 times (vanilla amount),
# any of those completions has 20% chance to restock all trades. So if you manage to trade 8 times,
# the plugin will roll a dice 8 times, and every roll has 20% chance. This value is vanilla.
#
# Players will still need to close the trade window for the plugin to check if it should restock trades.
